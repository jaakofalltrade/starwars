# Starwars Website

A simple starwars app that you can **search** and **browse** characters to see information.

## What I used

I used [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for most of the coding part, [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the fonts and [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) the starwars api for the starwars data. I also used a separate hardcoded json file for the image links because [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) does not contain image links. I forgot who owns that json file so if anyone knows who is the **original owner** of the json file *contact me*.

## How to run

There is not much to it. You can run this via __live server__ in **VSCode**, **XAMPP**, or by even opening the **HTML file** in a browser.

You can access it  by
[http://localhost](http://localhost) in the browser if you used **live server** or **XAMPP**.
